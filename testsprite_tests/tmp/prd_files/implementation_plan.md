# Implementation Plan - MedQueue AI & EduMatch AI

## Project Overview
A dual-platform neural infrastructure for Healthcare (MedQueue AI) and Education (EduMatch AI).

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Project initialization with Vite, React, and Tailwind.
- [x] Modern UI design generation via Stitch MCP.
- [x] Core routing and page structure (Landing, MedQueue, EduMatch).
- [x] Real-time backend setup with Node.js and Socket.io.
- [x] Firebase configuration and security rules.

## Phase 2: Functional Components (Completed)
- [x] **MedQueue**: hospital dashboard, bed allocation visualization, and AI symptom checker.
- [x] **EduMatch**: student dashboard, aptitude test simulator, and AI mentor interface.
- [x] Premium animations and glassmorphism styling.
- [x] **Universal Auth**: Unified login/signup portal for all user roles.

## Phase 3: Integration (In Progress)
- [x] Connect frontend components to real Backend APIs.
- [x] Create Python-based ML Service (FastAPI) for predictive analytics.
- [x] **AI Neural Core**: Real-time OpenAI GPT-4 integration for Symptom Checking & Career Mentoring.
- [x] **Communication Layer**: Integrated Twilio for OTP, Booking Confirmations, and Emergency Alerts.
- [x] **Maps Infrastructure**: Integrated Google Maps API with live bed availability visualization.
- [x] **Firebase Core**: Initialized Firebase with production config (Authentication & Firestore ready).
- [x] **Full-Stack Wiring**: Connected all frontend UI components to real Backend & AI services.
- [x] **Neural ML Integration**: Fully integrated Python-based ML services for Wait Time & Career Matching.
- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Hosting.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Firebase Admin SDK.
